TO RUN TEST

1. "/tmp" directory must exist and must be writable by the user who will
  run this test.
  e.g. the following should be done by a gfarm administrator:
	gfmkdir /tmp
	gfchmod 777 /tmp

2. run "make check"

optional variables:
	$GFARM_TEST_CKSUM_MISMATCH=<path>
					... a file which causes cksum mismatch
	$GFARM_TEST_MDS2=<host>:<port>	... optional gfmd
	$GFARM_TEST_MDS3=<host>:<port>	... optional gfmd
	$GFARM_TEST_MDS4=<host>:<port>	... optional gfmd

optional conditions:
	- whether this user have the gfarmadm group privilege or not.
	- whether this user have the gfarmroot group privilege or not.
	- whether there are at least two filesystem nodes or not.
	- whether there are at least two users or not.
	- whether XML attribute is enabled by the configure command or not.
	- whether cksum calculation is enabled or not.
	- whether client-side cksum calculation is enabled or not.
	- which cksum type is set
	- whether $GFARM_TEST_CKSUM_MISMATCH is set or not
	- the $GFARM_TEST_CKSUM_MISMATCH is larger than client_file_bufsize
	- whether $GFARM_TEST_MDS* is set or not

TO WRITE TEST
- each test should be independent from other test.
i.e.
- each test shouldn't assume the order of the tests.
- each test should clear the changes made by the test before exiting.

TODO
- test by root?
