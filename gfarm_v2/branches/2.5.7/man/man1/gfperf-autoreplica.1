.SH NAME
gfperf-autoreplica \- Gfarm measure autoreplica performance
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfperf-autoreplica\fR [ \fB-t, --testdir \fItest directory\fB\fR ] [ \fB-m, --gfarm2fs \fIgfarm2fs mount point\fB\fR ] [ \fB-l, --filesize \fIfile size\fB\fR ] [ \fB-f, --number \fInumber of files\fB\fR ] [ \fB-r, --replica \fInumber of replica\fB\fR ] [ \fB-s, --stop \fIwait time\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This command measures file creation performance in auto replication by gfmd. This command creates specified number of files in specified size. Between creation of files per second is performance of auto replica.
.PP
All test files are created in \fItest directory\fR, and automatically removed on success.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-t, --testdir \fItest directory\fB\fR
Test files are created in this directory.
Specify gfarm url (that begins with gfarm:///).
The default is 'gfarm:///tmp'.
.TP
\fB-m, --gfarm2fs \fIgfarm2fs mount point\fB\fR
Specify gfarm2fs mount point.
.TP
\fB-l, --filesize \fIfile size\fB\fR
File size to be created.
The default is 1G. (1G = 2^30)
.TP
\fB-f, --number \fInumber of files\fB\fR
Number of files to be created.
The default is 10.
.TP
\fB-r, --replica \fInumber of replica\fB\fR
Number of replica that is automatically replicated by gfmd.
The default is 1.
.TP
\fB-s, --stop \fIwait time\fB\fR
Wait time for file replication in seconds.
The default is 60 seconds.
