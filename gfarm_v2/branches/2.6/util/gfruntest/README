How to run tests with gfruntest

* requirements

In following description we call an Unix user who executes gfruntest
as 'test_user'.

  + test_user must be registered as a Gfarm user.
  + test_user should be able to log on to remote hosts by ssh with
    no password (using ssh-agent is recommended).
  + In some tests, test_user should be listed in /etc/sudoers with
    NOPASSWD tag like follows:
	test_user	ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL
  + In some tests, test_user need to be in gfarmroot/gfarmadm Gfarm group.

* create gfservice.conf file

To run gfruntest, you have to create gfservice.conf file which
specifies your Gfarm environment. Following variable definitions are
essential.

 + <host_id>_GFBINDIR
   path to gfservice on each remote host.
   <host_id> is something like gfmd1, gfmd2, gfsd1, gfsd2, client1, client2,...

 + gfmd*_CONFIG_GFARM_OPTIONS
   command line option given to config-gfarm when gfmd is configured.
   <gfmd*> is something like gfmd1, gfmd2, ...

 + gfsd*_CONFIG_GFSD_OPTIONS
   command line option given to config-gfsd when gfsd is configured.
   <gfsd*> is something like gfsd1, gfsd2, ...

 + client*_GFARM_CONF
   specify a gfarm2.conf file in absolute path.
   <client*> is something like client1, client2, ...

If Gfarm environment is configured with private mode, following
variables should be set to "true"

 + gfmd*_PRIVATE_MODE
 + gfsd*_PRIVATE_MODE

see gfservice.conf(5) for details

* execute gfruntest

gfruntest internally invokes a test script with (optional) parameters.

To execute gfruntest:
    % gfruntest -f <gfservice.conf> <testcase name>

    NOTE: <testcase name> is a filename under the following directory:
                  $prefix/share/gfarm/systest/testcases 

You can specify a parameter file with '-p' option.

    NOTE: <parameter file> is a filename under the following directory:
                  $prefix/share/gfarm/systest/parameters
          Most testcases don't need any parameter file though.
          The correspondence between a testcase and a parameter file
	  can be determined by their filenames.  i.e. A testcase name
	  is prefixed to corresponding testcases.

Debug log will be printed if you specify '-d' option.
