.SH NAME
gfperf-parallel-read \- Gfarm measure file read performance
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfperf-parallel-read\fR [ \fB-t, --testdir \fItest directory\fB\fR ] [ \fB-m, --gfarm2fs \fIgfarm2fs mount point\fB\fR ] [ \fB-l, --filesize \fIfile size\fB\fR ] [ \fB-b, --bufsize \fIbuffer size\fB\fR ] [ \fB-r, --random \fIrandom\fB\fR ] [ \fB-g, --gfsd \fIgfsd name\fB\fR ] [ \fB-k, --timeout \fItimeout seconds\fB\fR ] [ \fB-n, --name \fIgroup name\fB\fR ] [ \fB-w, --wait \fIstart time\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This command mesures file read performance of specified size of file in \fItest directory\fR\&.
The test file is automatically created and not removed to be reused again.
.PP
This command is expected to be called by gfperf.rb in parallel.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-t, --testdir \fItest directory\fB\fR
Test file is created in \fItest directory\fR\&.
Specify only gfarm url (that begins with gfarm:///) .
The default is gfarm:///tmp .
.TP
\fB-m, --gfarm2fs \fIgfarm2fs mount point\fB\fR
Specify gfarm2fs mount point.
.TP
\fB-l, --filesize \fIfile size\fB\fR
File size to be created.
The default is 1M. (1G=2^20)
.TP
\fB-b, --bufsize \fIbuffer size\fB\fR
Buffer size to read test file.
The default is 4K. (1K=2^10)
.TP
\fB-r, --random \fIrandom\fB\fR
Only if this option is specified, Reads test file randomly.
Option parameter is free. 
If this option is omitted, this command reads test file sequentially.
.TP
\fB-g, --gfsd \fIgfsd name\fB\fR
Specify gfsd name on which test file is created.
If this option is omitted, gfmd determines automatically.
.TP
\fB-k, --timeout \fItimeout seconds\fB\fR
Maximum read time in seconds.
This comannd measures how much data to be read in this seconds.
.TP
\fB-n, --name \fIgroup name\fB\fR
Group name in parallel execution.
.TP
\fB-w, --wait \fIstart time\fB\fR
Start time specified by gfperf.rb.
This command waits until start time.
Start time is written in UTC (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ) and
must be in 10 seconds from current time.
