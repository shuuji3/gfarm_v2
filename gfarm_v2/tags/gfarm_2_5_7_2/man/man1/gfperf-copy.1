.SH NAME
gfperf-copy \- Gfarm measure file copy performance
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfperf-copy\fR \fB-s, --src \fIsource url\fB\fR \fB-d, --dst \fIdestination url\fB\fR [ \fB-l, --filesize \fIfile size\fB\fR ] [ \fB-b, --busize \fIbuffer size\fB\fR ] [ \fB-g, --gfsd \fIgfsd name\fB\fR ] [ \fB-m, --gfarm2fs \fIgfarm2fs mount point\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This command measures file copy performance from source directory to destination directory. One of source and destination url must be gfarm url (that begins with gfarm:///). Other must be file url (that begins with file:///).
.PP
Test file is automatically created but source file is not removed. When this command is executed on same parameters, source file is reused again.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-s, --src \fIsource url\fB\fR
Test file is created automatically in source url. If \fIsource url\fR is gfarm url, \fIdestination url\fR must be file url.
.TP
\fB-d, --dst \fIdestination url\fB\fR
Test file is copied to \fIdestination url\fR\&. If \fIdestinatiln url\fR is gfarm url, \fIsource url\fR must be file url.
.TP
\fB-l, --filesize \fIfile size\fB\fR
File size to be created.
The default is 1M. (1M=2^20)
.TP
\fB-b, --bufsize \fIbuffer size\fB\fR
Copy buffer size.
The default is 4K. (1K=2^10)
.TP
\fB-g, --gfsd \fIgfsd name\fB\fR
Target gfsd name. Test file is created or copied on this gfsd.
If no gfsd is specified, gfmd determines automatically.
.TP
\fB-m, --gfarm2fs \fIgfarm2fs mount point\fB\fR
Specify gfarm2fs mount point.
This mount point path is added to gfarm url.
