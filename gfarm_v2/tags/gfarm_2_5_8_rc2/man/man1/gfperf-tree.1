.SH NAME
gfperf-tree \- Gfarm measure directory tree performance
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfperf-tree\fR [ \fB-t, --testdir \fItest directory\fB\fR ] [ \fB-w, --width \fInumber of directories\fB\fR ] [ \fB-d, --depth \fIdepth of directories\fB\fR ] [ \fB-u, --unit \fIoutput unit\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This command creates a directory tree in \fItest directory\fR\&. And measures performance creating directory tree and removing it.
The created directory tree has \fInumber of directories\fR in each subdirectories. Total depth of the tree is \fI depth of directories\fR
.PP
Output unit is ops (operation per second) or usec (micro second).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-t, --testdir \fItest directory\fB\fR
Directory tree is created in \fItest directory\fR\&.
If gfarm url (that begins with gfarm:///) is specified, measured by gfarm functions. If file url (that begins with file:///) is specified, measured by posix functions.
The default is gfarm:///tmp .
.TP
\fB-w, --width \fInumber of directories\fB\fR
Specify number of directories in each subdirectories.
.TP
\fB-d, --depth \fIdepth of directories\fB\fR
Total depth of directory tree.
.TP
\fB-u, --uinit \fIoutput unit\fB\fR
Specify ops (operations per second) or usec (micro second).
The default is ops.
