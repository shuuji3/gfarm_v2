gfperf-parallel-autoreplica \- Gfarm measure autoreplica performance
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfperf-parallel-autoreplica\fR [ \fB-t, --testdir \fItest directory\fB\fR ] [ \fB-m, --gfarm2fs \fIgfarm2fs mount point\fB\fR ] [ \fB-l, --filesize \fIfile size\fB\fR ] [ \fB-f, --number \fInumber of files\fB\fR ] [ \fB-r, --replica \fInumber of replica\fB\fR ] [ \fB-s, --stop \fIwait time\fB\fR ] [ \fB-n, --name \fIgroup name\fB\fR ] [ \fB-w, --wait \fIstart time\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This command creates specified number of files of specified size in \fItest directory\fR\&.
The created files will be automatically replicated by gfmd. This command measures creation time of the files.
.PP
This command is expected to be called by gfperf.rb in parallel.
.SH "OPTIONS"

Files are created in \fItest directory\fR\&.
Specify only gfarm url (that begins with gfarm:///) .
The default is gfarm:///tmp .
.TP
\fB-m, --gfarm2fs \fIgfarm2fs mount point \fB\fR
Specify gfarm2fs mount point.
.TP
\fB-l, --filesize \fIfile size\fB\fR
File size to be created.
The default is 1G. (1G=2^30)
.TP

Number of files to be created.
The default is 10.
.TP
\fB-r, --replica \fInumber of replica\fB\fR
Number of replica.
The default is 1.
.TP
\fB-s, --stop \fIwait time\fB\fR
Wait time in seconds for replication.
The default is 60 seconds.
.TP
\fB-n, --name \fIgroup name\fB\fR
