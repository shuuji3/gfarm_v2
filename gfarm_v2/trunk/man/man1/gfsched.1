.SH NAME
gfsched \- schedule and display available filesystem nodes
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfsched\fR [ \fB-f \fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR ] [ \fB-n \fInumber\fB\fR ] [ \fB-LMlw\fR ]


\fBgfsched\fR [ \fB-P \fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR ] [ \fB-D \fInumber\fB\fR ] [ \fB-n \fInumber\fB\fR ] [ \fB-LMlw\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBgfsched\fR command
with a \fB-f\fR \fIgfarm-URL\fR option
displays available filesystem nodes which have a file replica of the
specified gfarm-URL.
.PP
When a \fB-f\fR \fIgfarm-URL\fR option
is not specified, the \fBgfsched\fR command just displays
available filesystem nodes.  In this case, you can specify a metadata
server by a \fB-P\fR \fIgfarm-URL\fR option,
if necessary.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-D \fIdomain-name4\fB\fR
Limits filesystem node by specifying a domain name or a hostname.

Currently, this option doesn't work with the \fB-f\fR option.
.TP
\fB-L\fR
Suppresses authentication check.
Without this option, the scheduler checks whether the user will be 
successfully authenticated with the hosts or not.
This option omits the check to make scheduling faster,
but that creates a risk that hosts which fail authentication with
the user may be scheduled.
.TP
\fB-M\fR
Suppresses client-side scheduling and only performs metadata-server-side
scheduling.
This option makes scheduling faster,
but also creates a risk that hosts which is network-unreachable or
fails authentication with the user may be scheduled.
.TP
\fB-P \fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR
Specifies a \fIgfarm-URL\fR or a pathname
to identify a metadata server which is used for the scheduling.
This option conflicts with an \fB-f\fR\&.
.TP
\fB-f \fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR
The \fBgfsched\fR command schedules filesystem nodes
which have a replica of a file specified by this option.
This option conflicts with a \fB-P\fR option.
.TP
\fB-l\fR
Long format.
This option displays port numbers as well as hostnames.
Note that the display format of this option may be changed in future.
.TP
\fB-n \fInumber\fB\fR
Displays specified number of filesystem nodes at most.
If this option is not specified, it displays all available nodes.
.TP
\fB-w\fR
Schedules with write-mode.
When this option is specified, filesystem nodes which don't have
enough free space won't be displayed.

When both this option and an \fB-f\fR are specified,
and if the file is already opened by an existing process with write-mode,
the \fBgfsched\fR command only displays one filesystem node
which is assigned for writing to the file.
.TP
\fB-?\fR
Displays a list of command options.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The following is an example to inquire filesystem nodes that the metadata
server thinks they are currently working.

.nf
$ gfsched -M
.fi
