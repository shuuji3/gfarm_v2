.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfrep\fR creates replicas of Gfarm files
specified by the \fIGfarm-URL\fR\&.
.PP
If the \fIGfarm-URL\fR parameter is a directory,
it will be copied recursively.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-D \fIdestination-domainname\fB\fR
Specifies the domain name of destination filesystem nodes to which
replicas will be copied.
This option is used alone, or with the \fB-S\fR
or \fB-s\fR option.

If neither this nor the \fB-d\fR option is specified, 
replicas may be copied to any of the hosts registered in the metadata.
Please refer to the description of the \fB-N\fR option for details.
.TP
\fB-d \fIdestination-node\fB\fR
Specifies one destination filesystem node where replicas
will be copied.
This option is used alone, or with the \fB-s\fR 
option.

If neither this nor the \fB-D\fR option is specified, 
replicas may be copied to any of the hosts registered in the metadata.
.TP
\fB-H \fIhostfile\fB\fR
Specifies a file which describes hostnames of
destination filesystem nodes on which the replica will be made.
The \fIhostfile\fR consists of a filesystem node name
on each line.
If the number of nodes listed in the \fIhostfile\fR
is less than the total number of file fragments,
it is treated as if the node names are specified repeatedly.

if ``-'' is specified, standard input is used to read the host list.
.TP
\fB-I \fIfile-section\fB\fR
Specifies a file section name to be copied.
Currently, this option can be specified only with the \fB-d\fR
option.

It is possible to omit this option.
.TP
\fB-m\fR
Lets gfrep command do a migrate/move, instead of doing replication.
Currently, this works only with the -H, -P and -d options.
.TP
\fB-N \fInum-of-replicas\fB\fR
Specifies the required number of file replicas, counting already
existing ones.
If there are a sufficient number of replicas in the destination nodes,
neither any copying nor any removal will be done.
This option is used alone, or with the \fB-D\fR,
\fB-S\fR or \fB-s\fR option.

If this option is not specified, \fB-N 1\fR is assumed.

The source nodes specified by the \fB-S\fR
or \fB-s\fR option are excluded from the destination nodes.
In other words, it's guaranteed that the number of replicas on
hosts, except those specified by the \fB-S\fR or \fB-s\fR
option, are the same or more than the number specified by the
\fB-N\fR option.
However, when the destination is a subset of the source,
i.e. when the exclusion makes the destination an empty set,
this exclusion is not applied.
For example, if gfrep is executed with the
``\fB-N 3 -S subdomain.example.org -D example.org\fR\&'' option,
it's guaranteed that there are at least 3 replicas in the hosts belonging
to example.org, excepting subdomain.example.org.
.TP
\fB-P \fIhost-pair-file\fB\fR
Specifies a file which describes hostname pairs of
source nodes and destination nodes.
The \fIhost-pair-file\fR consists of a pair
of a source node name and a destination node name in this order on each line.
The replica will be copied to the destination node, only if it exists
on the source node of the pair.
.TP
\fB-S \fIsource-domainname\fB\fR
Specifies the domain name of source filesystem nodes where replicas
will be copied from.
This option is used alone, or with the \fB-D\fR
option.

If neither this nor the \fB-s\fR option is specified, 
the source nodes will be selected from all nodes.

The hosts specified by this option will be excluded from
the destination nodes.
Please refer to the description of the \fB-N\fR option for details.
.TP
\fB-s \fIsource-node\fB\fR
Specifies a source filesystem node where replicas
will be copied from.
This option is used alone, or with the \fB-D\fR
or \fB-d\fR option.

If neither this nor the \fB-s\fR option is specified, 
the source nodes will be selected from all nodes.

The host specified by this option will be excluded from
the destination nodes.
Please refer to the description of the \fB-N\fR option for details.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Displays verbose output.
.TP
\fB-?\fR
Displays a list of command options.
