.SH NAME
gfservice \- control Gfarm servers from a remote host
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfservice\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] \fBsub-command\fR \fBhost-id\fR [ \fB\fIargument ...\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfservice\fR is an utility for Gfarm administrators
to operate servers (\fBgfmd\fR, \fBgfsd\fR and
PostgreSQL) on remote hosts.
OpenLDAP is not supported currently.
It can start, stop, set up (execute \fBconfig-gfarm\fR
and \fBconfig-gfsd\fR) and clean up the servers, for example.
.PP
A sample command line of \fBgfservice\fR looks like:

.nf
	\fBgfservice \fIstart-gfmd\fB \fIgfmd2\fB\fR
.fi
.PP
where "\fIstart-gfmd\fR" is a sub-command and
\fIgfmd2\fR is a host-id respectively.
Executing the command, \fBgfservice\fR tries to start gfmd
on the host named \fIgfmd2\fR\&.
To specify a remote server host, \fBgfservice\fR uses
host-id instead of hostname.
All host-ids (\fIgfmd1\fR,
\fIgfmd2\fR, and so on) are defined in a configuration
file of \fBgfservice\fR\&.
Here is an example of the configuration file:

.nf
	gfmd1=metadb1.example.com
	gfmd1_CONFIG_GFARM_OPTIONS="-A $LOGNAME -X"
	gfmd2=metadb2.example.com
	gfmd2_CONFIG_GFARM_OPTIONS="-A $LOGNAME -X"

	gfsd1=spool1.example.com
	gfsd2=spool2.example.com
.fi
.PP
\fBgfservice\fR determines a path of the configuration
file to be read with the following procedures:
.TP 3
1. 
\fB-f\fR \fIfile\fR option is specified, read
\fIfile\fR\&.
.TP 3
2. 
Otherwise, the environment variable
GFSERVICE_CONF is defined and not empty, read the file.
.TP 3
3. 
Otherwise, read \fI$HOME/.gfservice\fR\&.
.PP
If \fBgfservice\fR fails to read a configuration file,
it prints an error message and exits immediately.
Note that the configuration file itself is a Bourne-shell script and
\fBgfservice\fR includes (exactly to say, 
\fBevaluates\fR) the file.
See gfservice.conf(5) for more details about the configuration file.
.PP
\fBgfservice\fR uses SSH (Secure Shell) to connect with
a remote host.
Since it may execute \fBssh\fR several times during a
sub-command operation, it is recommended to use an SSH agent
(e.g. \fBssh-agent\fR of OpenSSH) or an authentication key
with an empty passphrase to avoid typing a passphrase every time.
.PP
In addition with SSH, \fBgfservice\fR uses Sudo to get
root privilege on the remote host.
Please add a line like below to \fIsudoers\fR file
(Sudo's configuration file) on each remote host.

.nf
	\fIuser\fR ALL=(root, _gfarmfs, _gfarmmd) NOPASSWD: gfservice-agent
.fi
.PP
where \fIuser\fR is an user name who executes
\fBgfservice\fR\&.
The NOPASSWD option is not mandatory, but \fBsudo\fR may
ask you a password several times if omitted.
.PP
Since \fBgfservice\fR executes an agent command named
\fBgfservice-agent\fR on the remote host using SSH and Sudo,
\fBgfservice-agent\fR command must have been installed on
all hosts you want to operate using \fBgfservice\fR\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Print debug information.
\fBgfservice\fR passes this option to
\fBgfservice-agent\fR so that also
\fBgfservice-agent\fR outputs debug information.
.TP
\fB-f \fIfile\fB\fR
Read configuration from \fIfile\fR instead of the default.
.TP
\fB-t \fItime\fB\fR
Set operation timeout in \fItime\fR seconds.
When \fBgfservice\fR tries to start or stop a server program
(gfmd, gfsd or a backend database), it waits until the operation is complete
or \fItime\fR interval is elapsed.
If "no" is specified as \fItime\fR, timeout never occurs.
The default value is "no".
.SH "SUB-COMMANDS FOR GFMD"
.PP
The followings are sub-commands which operate \fBgfmd\fR\&.
The given host-id argument must be "gfmd\fIn\fR"
(gfmd1, gfmd2, ...).
Otherwise \fBgfservice\fR reports an error and exits
immediately.

on the remote host runs in master mode.
.TP

deletes it and then add a new line.
.TP
\fBunset-gfmd-conf \fIdirective\fB\fR

\fBgfservice\fR reads a backup of \fIgfmd.conf\fR
from standard in.
.TP
\fBconfig-gfarm\fR
Execute \fBconfig-gfarm\fR command on the remote host.
If "gfmd\fIn\fR_CONFIG_GFARM_OPTIONS" variable is
declared in the configuration file of \fBgfservice\fR,
its value is passed to \fBconfig-gfarm\fR command as
options.
Don't use this sub-command when you want to enable replicatoin of gfmd.
Instead, use "\fBconfig-gfarm-master\fR" or
"\fBconfig-gfarm-slave\fR" sub-command in that case.
If authentication type is "sharedsecret", \fBgfservice\fR
also creates a shared secret key using \fBgfkey\fR command
and then distribute the key and \fIgfarm2.conf\fR file
to all hosts defined in the configuration file 
(gfmd\fIn\fR, gfsd\fIn\fR and
client\fIn\fR).
.TP
\fBconfig-gfarm-master\fR

but gfmd replication is enabled automatically.
.TP
\fBconfig-gfarm-slave \fImaster-host-id\fB\fR
This sub-command is the same as \fBconfig-gfarm\fR
but gfmd replication is enabled automatically and the remote gfmd host
is configured as a slave of \fImaster-host-id\fR\&.
Then \fBgfservice\fR registers the slave host to a server list
using \fBgfmdhost\fR command.
\fBgfservice\fR also adds the slave host to
metadb_server_list directive in
\fIgfarm2.conf\fR file on the master gfmd host and
distribute the updated \fIgfarm2.conf\fR file to all hosts
defined in the configuration file (gfmd\fIn\fR,
gfsd\fIn\fR and client\fIn\fR).
.TP
\fBunconfig-gfarm\fR
Execute "\fBstop-gfarm\fR" sub-command and then delete all
files and directories created by gfmd and a backend database.

"\fBunconfig-gfarm-slave\fR" sub-command instead.
.TP
\fBunconfig-gfarm-master\fR
An alias of "\fBunconfig-gfarm\fR" sub-command.
.TP
\fBunconfig-gfarm-slave \fImaster-host-id\fB\fR
This sub-command is the same as "\fBunonfig-gfarm\fR",
but \fBgfservice\fR does some additional works.
It also deletes the slave host from a server list using
\fBgfmdhost\fR command and from
metadb_server_list directive in
\fIgfarm2.conf\fR file on all hosts defined in the
configuration file (gfmd\fIn\fR, 
gfsd\fIn\fR and client\fIn\fR).

If "gfsd\fIn\fR_CONFIG_GFSD_OPTIONS" variable is
declared in the configuration file of \fBgfservice\fR,
its value is passed to \fBconfig-gfsd\fR command as
options.
\fBgfservice\fR also registers the configured remote host
as a filesystem node using \fBgfhost\fR command.
